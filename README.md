#Monthly Call Center Dashboard – Personal Project 

##Project Objective 

Based on my hands-on experience working in a call center, I came up with the idea to create a dashboard for monthly reporting. This dashboard is designed for team leaders, supervisors, and higher-level managers to get a clear overview of monthly key performance metrics, such as total calls by channel (Call-Center, Chatbot, Email, Web), average customer satisfaction score (CSAT), and average call duration. 

The goal is to present the performance and identify underperforming areas in agent performance to provide insights into which KPIs are being met successfully and which ones require more focus and improvement. 

This tool also contributes to building a smarter, more efficient analysis process — optimizing reporting and enhancing operational performance moving forward.
